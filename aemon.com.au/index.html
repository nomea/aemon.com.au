      <p>
      When showing a friend of mine this website he asked me, "Why have you made a website? What's it for?", my response was "It's not for anything, I could so I did!". 
      I'll clarify that now by saying "For my own enjoyment and the challenge, to put my skills to the test and create! For the fun of it!". 
      All things I love, challenges, the opportunity to create, testing my skills and having fun. I've toyed with the design, added some pictures of my family and friends, 
      and created links to my <a href="blog">blog</a> and my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>. Why not!

    I was born in <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=lorinna&hnear=Lorinna+Tasmania&gl=au&t=h&z=13&iwloc=A">Lorinna</a>, Tasmania in 1979. 
     My father built the small wooden cottage I was born in himself, cutting by hand each wooden shingle that covered the rustic little buildings roof. 
    After a few years living in this idyllic valley in the Tasmanian wilderness, my parents moved back to NSW and during my early childhood my father worked as a caretaker for the Sydney University. 
    He was first employed at the Mills Cross Radio Telescope now know as <a href="http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/sifa/Main/MOST">MOST</a> 
    (nice satellite image <a href="http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/molonglo-observatory-synthesis-telescope/view/?service=0">here</a>), 
    before moving to Pearl Beach on the NSW Central Coast and taking care of <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/biology/research/crommelin/">The Crommelin Research Station</a>.

      While living in NSW I attended <a href="http://www.bungendore-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/">Bungendore Public School</a> and <a href="http://www.umina-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/home">Umina Public School</a>. 
      During this time I was joined on this planet by my brother and two sisters. In order of arrival, Samara, Lillia and Pippin. <a href="brosis.html">photo.</a>
      In 1990 we returned as a family to Tasmania. 
      My father began a new career as an arborist and I completed my primary school years at <a href="http://www.perth.tased.edu.au/index2.htm">Perth Primary School</a> attending years 5 and 6. 
      From 1992 to 1995 I attended <a href="https://education.tas.edu.au/kingsmeadowshs/Pages/Home.aspx">Kings Meadows High School</a>  
      and after a challenging period for the staff at Kings Meadows High I completed high school, winning the schools Art Award in my final year.

      While at high school I made some important friends, most notably William Hernandez, Tom Martschinke and Tinu Karki. 
      Will was born in El Salvador, Tom was a first generation Australian with a German father and Irish mother and Tinu was born in Nepal. 
      One of the side effects of this ethnic collection of friends was an unusually high amount of exposure to soccer. This exposure lead to a habit that was fuelled daily in Launceston's streets and parks.
      While playing soccer with Will, Tom and Tinu I also made another great friend, Mark Baker. Mark would later attend my wedding as my best man.

      During 1996 and 1997 I continued study art at Launceston College (<a href="http://www.launc.tased.edu.au/">LC</a>). 
      I played bass guitar in a band called <a href="noodles.html">Noodles Romanov</a> (named after the villain from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/ROGER-RAMJET/28074623565">Roger Ramjet</a>) and had some great times with Tom Martschinke and Jay Allen.
      Amazingly, considering my poor attendance record, by 1997 I had completed my <a href="http://www.tqa.tas.gov.au/1906">TCE</a>. It was also in 1997 that I met Georgia Lodge.
      </p>
      <p>
      For the next few years I continued studying art at both Launceston Tafe and at the University of Tasmania. In 1998 Georgia fell pregnant and on the 22nd of February 1999 we were joined by our beautiful baby girl which we named Eva May.

      <p>
      In 2000 I moved from art to graphic design and began working as a trainee signwriter. On the 17th of Febuary 2001 I was able to convince Georgia Lodge to marry me and on the 12th of July in the same year we had our second child a bady boy we named Emerson Jay.
      We lived in Launceston for the next few years and I worked various jobs support my growing family. On the 25th of November in 2003 Georgia and I had our third and final child a little baby boy who we named Irah James.
